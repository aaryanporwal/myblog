    <h1 id="designing-no-collision-guarantee-system">Designing No Collision Guarantee System.</h1>
<p>So for the past few days, I&rsquo;ve been trying to build a <em>distributed highly scalable, no collision guaranteed URL shortening service</em>.</p>
<h2 id="the-architecture">The Architecture</h2>
<p>So if you pass in a long url called <code>https://longurl.com</code>, the backend will send you a short url that would be unique to each request, and the structure of the url would look something like: <code>https://shorturl.com/[slug]</code>.</p>
<p>The slug is our main component, it should always be unique.</p>
<p>Some things to note:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The length of the slug depends on how many entries will there be.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>So for 5 digit alphanumeric (also called Base-62) slug:</p>
<p>Possible combinations: 26 (small alphabets) + 26 (capital alphabets) + 10 (numbers) =&gt; 62.</p>
<p>So, for 5 digit base62 -&gt; 62^5 ~about 900 million possibilities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="what-choices-do-we-have-to-ensure-uniqueness-of-the-slug">What choices do we have to ensure uniqueness of the slug?</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Random slug</p>
<p>-&gt; This can be any random alphanumeric characters.</p>
<p>-&gt; The problem here is that for a request, there can be two same random characters, which will eventually result in collisions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using MD5</p>
<p>-&gt; Collisions are possible here as well (although very rare, but we want no collision guarantee).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Time Stamp</p>
<p>-&gt; You can store time stamp of every request and encode it with base62, but this still can result in collisions.</p>
<p>-&gt; Just to give an example, if you generate 10 ids a second with a granularity of milliseconds, the probability of a collision is 1 in 23. On average, you&rsquo;ll have a collision every 23 seconds. But it&rsquo;s worse than that. The assumption in this math is that every possible birthday is equally likely. That&rsquo;s not true for birthdays, more people on born in the spring. It&rsquo;s also not going to be true for your timestamps. You are going to get much heavier on certain times of the day than others <sup><a href="https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/305904/how-likely-are-collisions-of-timestamp-based-identifiers">1</a></sup>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>UUIDs</p>
<p>-&gt; UUID is part of the Distributed Computing Environment (DCE), standardized by the Open Software Foundation (OSF).</p>
<p>-&gt; How UUID is made:

<p>-&gt; Also check out this amazing blog about collisions in UUIDs <a href="https://www.scaleyourapp.com/uuid-guid-oversimplified-are-they-really-unique/">here</a>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Using a <u><strong>Counter</strong></u></p>
<p>-&gt; Counters are the only thing that can <strong>guarantee</strong> no collisions. This is true if we only use a single database, which is bad for scaling. For multiple distributed database, we again have a problem!</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="the-problem-with-counter">The problem with counter</h1>
<p>For a no collision guarantee URL shortening system (single database), our unique id i.e our slug will be a counter.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>our first slug will be: 10000 =&gt; (2bI)<sub>base62</sub></li>
<li>second: 10001</li>
<li>third: 10002 and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now the problem is when we want to horizontally scale and talk with multiple databases.</p>
<p>The different approaches with multi database counter will look like:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>One counter for all databases</p>
<p>-&gt; This will ensure atomicity, but will slow down response time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Different counter for different databases</p>
<p>-&gt; This approach will be faster, but the problem is how will we ensure that there are no collisions between two different counters?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="problem-with-counter-synchronization">Problem with counter synchronization</h2>
<p>The problem with counter synchronization is that there can be two counters with same value.</p>
<p>Here comes our <a href="https://zookeeper.apache.org/">Apache zookeeper</a>.</p>
<p>What zookeeper would do is assign different counter ranges to different databases or servers.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>DB<sub>1</sub> is assigned counter range from 10000 to 20000</li>
<li>DB<sub>2</sub> is assigned counter range from 20001 to 30000</li>
<li>DB<sub>3</sub> is assigned counter range from 30001 to 40000</li>
<li>DB<sub>4</sub> is assigned counter range from 40001 to 50000 and so on.</li>
</ul>
<p>And zookeeper will also keep track of the counter usage so that it if a database exceeds the range, it is assigned a new range.</p>
<p>In conclusion, for our distributed no collision guaranteed url shortening service, we can use counters to guarantee no collisions and use apache zookeeper to synchronize the counters across databases.</p>
